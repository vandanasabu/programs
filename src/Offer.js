                                         in South America, this is the place to come. The ancient Inca
                                          city of Machu Picchu is arguably the most impressive ruined
                                           city in the world.Much of the attraction comes from its 
                                           location, high in the jungle-clad mountains of Peru. Set on a 
                                           high plateau with soaring green mountains, the setting is 
                                           surreal. The sheer tenacity of the original builders to create
                                            this amazing place in what would have been impenetrable
                                             jungle, is, in itself, impressive.Visitor numbers are now
